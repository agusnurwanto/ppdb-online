# Carbon Fields Unit Tests

## Initial Setup

Install WordPress and the WP Unit Test lib using the `install.sh` script. Change to the plugin root directory and type:

Sample usage:

    $ tests/bin/install.sh carbon_fields_tests root root localhost 4.7

**Important**: Make sure that the `<db-name>` database has been created. Note that all data will be removed during testing.

    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit

Refer to the [phpunit command line test runner reference](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/phpunit-book.html#textui) for more information and command line options.
